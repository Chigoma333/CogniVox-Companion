## Warning: Shared Memory

CogniVox-Companion utilizes shared memory for long-term context and personalized responses. However, please be aware that this means every user interacting with the bot will be considered as the same person in the shared memory. The bot does store all conversations as memory, but it is designed to provide consistent responses based on past interactions across all users. Do not share any sensitive or personally identifiable information while interacting with the bot.

# Warning: Resource Usage

CogniVox-Companion runs entirely locally on your server to ensure data privacy. However, please be aware that the bot may consume significant resources. On average, it uses up to 10GB of RAM and 4GB of VRAM, especially during memory-intensive tasks such as text generation. Make sure your server can handle these resource requirements to avoid performance issues.
